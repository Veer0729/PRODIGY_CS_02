# Password Complexity Checker

This code checks the strength of a user-inputted password based on its length and character types. It checks for:

Length: Must be at least 8 characters
Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Digits, and Special characters
The code then categorizes the password strength as:

Very weak (1 character type)
Weak (2 character types)
Decent (3 character types)
Strong (4 character types)
